## Command Design Pattern Motivation
- Uses:
  - multi-level undo/redo
  - macro recording
  - GUI commands
- `command` - An object which represents an instruction to perform a particular action. Contains all the information necessary for the action to be taken.
- Encapsulate all details of an operation in a separate object
- Define functions for applying the command(either in the command itself, or elsewhere)
- Optionally define instructions for undoing the command
- Can create composite commands(a.k.a. macros)
