## Composite Design Pattern Motivation
- Treating individual and aggregate objects uniformly
- Objects use other objects' fields/methods through embedding
- Composition lets us make compound objects
- `Composite Design pattern` - is used to treat both single(scalar) and composite objects uniformly(have the same interface)
  - Ex. Foo and []Foo have common APIs
- `Composite` - a mechanism for treating individual(scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.
