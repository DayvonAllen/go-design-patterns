## Decorator Design Pattern Motivation
- Adding behavior without altering the type itself.
- Want to augment an object with additional functionality
- We do not want to rewrite or alter existing code(Open Closed Principal)
- Want to keep new functionality separate(Separation Of Concerns)
- Need to be able to interact with existing structures
- Solution: embed the decorated object and provide additional functionality
- `Decorator Pattern` - facilitates the addition of behaviors to individual objects thorough embedding.
