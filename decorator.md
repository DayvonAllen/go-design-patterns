## Decorator Design Pattern Motivation
- Adding behavior without altering the type itself.
- Want to augment an object with additional functionality
- We do not want to rewrite or alter existing code(Open Closed Principal)
- Want to keep new functionality separate(Separation Of Concerns)
- Need to be able to interact with existing structures
- Solution: embed the decorated object and provide additional functionality
- `Decorator Pattern` - facilitates the addition of behaviors to individual objects thorough embedding.
- `Proxy` vs. `Decorator`:
    - Proxy tries to provide an identical interface
    - Decorator provides an enhanced interface
    - Decorator typically aggregates(or has pointer to) what it is decorating, proxy doesn't have to
    - Proxy might not even be working with a materialized object.
