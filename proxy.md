## Proxy Design Pattern Motivation
- An interface for accessing a particular resource
- Provide the same interface but entirely different behavior
- Types of proxies:
  - logging
  - virtual
  - guarding
  - communication
- `Proxy` - A type that functions as an interface to a particular resource. That resource may be remote, expensive to construct, or may require logging or some other added functionality.
- A proxy has the same interface as the underlying object
- To create a proxy, simply replicate the existing interface of an object
- Add relevant functionality to the redefined methods.
- `Proxy` vs. `Decorator`:
  - Proxy tries to provide an identical interface
  - Decorator provides an enhanced interface
  - Decorator typically aggregates(or has pointer to) what it is decorating, proxy doesn't have to
  - Proxy might not even be working with a materialized object.
