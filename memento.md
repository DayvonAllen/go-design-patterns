## Memento Design Pattern Motivation
- `memento` - A token representing the system state. Lets us roll back to the state when the token was generated. May or may not directly expose state information.
- `memento` vs `flyweight`:
  - Both patterns provide a 'token' clients can hold on to
  - Memento is used only to be fed back into the system:
    - N public/mutable state
    - no methods
  - A flyweight is similar to an ordinary reference to an object
    - Can mutate state
    - can provide additional functionality(fields/methods)
- Mementos are used to roll back state arbitrarily
- A memento is simply a token/handle with (typically) no methods of its own.
- Can be used to implement `undo/redo`
- A memento is not required to expose the state(s) to which it reverts
