## Chain Of Responsibility Design Pattern Motivation
- Sequence of handlers processing an event one after another
- `Chain Of Responsibility` - A chain of components who all get a chance to process a command or a query, optionally having default processing implementation and an ability to terminate the processing chain.
- Chain of Responsibility can be implemented as a linked list of pointers or a centralized construct
- Enlist objects in the chain, possibly controlling their order
- Control object removal from chain.
