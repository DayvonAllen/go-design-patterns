## Singleton Design Pattern Motivation
- For some components it only makes sense to have one in the system at any given time
  - Ex. Database repository
  - Object Factory(Stateless Factory)
- Construction calls could be expensive(ex. DB)
  - We only do it once
  - We give everyone the same instance
- Want to prevent anyone from creating additional copies
- We need to take care of lazy instantiation
- `Singleton` - a component which is instantiated only once.
- Problems:
  - Quite often breaks the dependency inversion principle of SOLID.
