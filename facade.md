## Facade Design Pattern Motivation
- Exposing several components through a single interface
- Balancing complexity and presentation/usability
- Abstract complexity of API or system from the user.
- Build a Facade to provide a simplified API over a set of components
- May wish to (optionally) expose internals through the facade
- May allow users to `escalate` to use more complex APIs if they need to.
- `Facade Pattern` - provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large sophisticated body of code
