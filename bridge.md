## Bridge Design Pattern Motivation
- Connecting components together through abstractions
- Bridge prevents a `Cartesian Product` complexity explosion
- Example:
  - Common type ThreadScheduler
  - Can be preemptive or cooperative
  - Can run on Windows or Unix
  - Naive solution to this problem:
    - You end up with a 2x2 scenario: WindowsPTS, UnixPTS, WindowsCTS, UnixCTS
- Bridge pattern avoids the entity explosion(above example) 
- `Bridge` - a mechanism that decouples an interface(hierarchy) from an implementation(hierarchy)
